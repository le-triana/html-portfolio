<h1>Triana's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Here are my favorite movies of all time. These are ones I will always rewatch.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>It's a feel-good movie. Not only is the art style a delight, but the story of Chihiro and her journey is a beautiful one. 
She's growing on her own and overcomes her troubles. The music score is one of my favorite things about the movie.
Overall, you come out of this movie with the feeling of content.</p>
<h3>Saw</h3>
<p>Now, I don't specifically mean just hte first Saw movie but rather the entire franchise.
True to the main antagonist, Jigsaw, all of the movies fit together like one giant puzzle. If
you're not a fan of gore or psychological thrillers, this isn't for the faint-hearted. The extremes of this movie
focus on the premise of: how badly do you want to live? Cherish every day like it's your last.</p>
<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>Coraline is one of my favorite childhood movies because of its perfect triage of animation style, plot and soundtrack.
There is no one like Coraline, and she is drawn into a world that, although seems wonderufl, is dangerous underneath the mask.
Step into the world of Coraline, and be prepared to experience a "family movie" like no family you've ever seen.

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>The music score was UNBELIEVABLE. Before this movie, I never knew that Hugh Jackman could sing so well!
Seeing his character grow into a businessman, a showman, and as an overall man makes you emphathize with 
his character and those around him who are affected by his actions. It's also a heartwarming thing to see
people deemed as "freaks" in society become a family because they no better than anyone what it feels like
to be unloved and outcasted. In this grand scheme to make money and put on a show, they found each other 
and their love for performing. I do indeed know all of the songs by heart.
