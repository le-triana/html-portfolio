<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi! My name is Triana Le. Welcome to my World!</h2>
<hr />
<p> I'm an aspiring web developer who recently just discovered: hey, I'm actually not bad at this! 
  I use to think that the only "technical" things I knew how to do was changing my screen saver and restart the computer.
  I spent some time thinking about why I wanted to go into web development. I had no background, prior knowledge, or CS degree.
  I grew using my right brain - live and think creatively and enjoy expressing myself through it. So how could I
  still utilize it in a profession while also retaining my indivudality and staying true to my craft and character?</p><br />

<p>I grew up in a small town outside Philadelphia, PA. I had big dreams of exploring cities and going beyond what I knew in my little town.
  I had dreamed of being an artist, a singer, a fashion designer, and a writer. I had only ever dreamed of creating. Fast forward to now,
  my boyfriend suggested I try a couple tech lectures. Since my journey began in March 2023, I've beome motivated to be a part of this industry.
  I realized that within the code, there's beauty to it. There's something amazing about writing a script for a website and seeing it displayed.
  There's an art to it.
</p><br />

<p>This is my portfolio. A culmination of my growth and my work. If you asked me a year ago if I knew this was my passion, I would've thought
  you were mistaken. I hope that Type with T will help you begin to see me as the web developer I want to be. Welcome to my world! I'm still
  a stranger to it myself, but I'm excited to share with you my jourey. Here's to Typing with T.
</p><br />

<p>Sincerely, Triana</p>
